Description: We want to automate the process of ad quality procedures/tracking/grunt work.

Two systems we are pulling info from:
-Confiant 
-Ad Lightning

The program will:
1. Go into each system depending on the URL
2. Pull the relevant information based off of:
    -vap(sovrn's ad call)
        -If not found, mark as passback.
    -campaign ID (4 numbers)
    -UCRID
    -SeatID (potentially)
3. Write this information to a csv output.`
